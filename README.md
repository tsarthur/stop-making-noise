A free app that will control your sound. Now loud sounds (gunshots, explosions, plane crashes) will become quieter, and quiet sounds (whispering, walking) will become loud. ‚Äî Now the sound will always be on the same wavelength!



‚Äî "My neighbors, stop making noise on the 3rd floor, stop watching action movies every night, please stop üò≠"

## Bugs and feature requests

## Contributing guidelines

All contributions are more than welcomed. Contributions may close an issue, fix a bug (reported or not reported), improve the existing code, add new feature, and so on. In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

The `dev` branch is the default and base branch for the project. It is used for development and all Pull Requests should go there. Please make sure not to commit the `dist` folder in the `dev` branch.

#### Development

The project needs to be compiled, therefore the files in the `src` folder are those we'll be developing on. Don't make changes in the `dist` or `demo` folders as they will be overwritten when `src` is compiled.

1. Get code

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tsarthur/stop-making-noise.git
cd stop-making-noise
```

2. Install dependencies and run project

```bash
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

With the server running, the project is available at the following address [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/). The `src` files are automatically compiled when changes have been made.

#### Versioning
Through the development of new versions, we're going use the Semantic Versioning: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning. Example: 1.0.0.
- Major release: increment the first digit and reset middle and last digits to zero. Introduces major changes that might break backward compatibility. E.g. 2.0.0
- Minor release: increment the middle digit and reset last digit to zero. It would fix bugs and also add new features without breaking backward compatibility. E.g. 1.1.0
- Patch release: increment the third digit. It would fix bugs and keep backward compatibility. E.g. 1.0.1
